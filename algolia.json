[{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introducing Twikoo What bolg would this be if it did not have any comment section? A shitty one, that\u0026amp;rsquo;s what. So one of the first things I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve worked on after officially publishing this bolg was figure out how to add comments. Guess I succeeded.\nWow, Ivo, that\u0026amp;rsquo;s so cool! How did you do it? I\u0026amp;rsquo;m glad you asked, fellow user. You see, this bolg is powered by Hugo (credited below). It\u0026amp;rsquo;s a cool framework that just\u0026amp;hellip; builds sites for you! Easy to install, especially if you\u0026amp;rsquo;re on Linux, and it needs few commands to get things done right. It also supports themes. Those are custom layouts built by hardworking people so that lazy folks like me can just take them for their own websites. (This one site\u0026amp;rsquo;s theme is also credited below.) Well, it seems that this theme integrates the front-end of two comment systems. From what I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve understood, one of them is paid.

Is there a lore reason for why The Great Ivo is stupid?\u0026amp;rdquo; Well, allow me to share some brief history on this website. As you may (have) come to learn, I was a student at the totally badass ETH Zurich. Cool place, they gave me a free WordPress blog licence. So one afternoon, while being tormented in class by discrete mathematics, I created The Great Ivo Blog. It was silly, absurd, and relied heavily on pre-made themes. Kind of like this one. So next week I went ahead and showed it to a classmate. He laughed plenty, and we paid no attention to class that morning, and even though he had his own dumb website, he made his own blog. Which he named bolg. This site is in memory of that classmate. May he rest in peace every night when he …","date":-62135596800,"dir":"about/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":500,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://ivomiricribeiro.github.io/TheGreatIvoBolg/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/TheGreatIvoBolg/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page","url":"/TheGreatIvoBolg/about/","weight":0,"wordcount":426},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"All of the art in this bolg is borrowed (taken without asking).
